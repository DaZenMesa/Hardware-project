			<div class="col-sm-4" id="row3"><p class="text">What is a Hard Drive?<br> <br> A hard disk drive (HDD), hard disk, hard drive, or fixed disk,[b] is an electromechanical data storage device that uses magnetic storage to store and retrieve digital information using one or more rigid rapidly rotating disks (platters) coated with magnetic material. The platters are paired with magnetic heads, usually arranged on a moving actuator arm, which read and write data to the platter surfaces.[2] Data is accessed in a random-access manner, meaning that individual blocks of data can be stored or retrieved in any order and not only sequentially. HDDs are a type of non-volatile storage, retaining stored data even when powered off. <br> <br> Introduced by IBM in 1956,[6] HDDs became the dominant secondary storage device for general-purpose computers by the early 1960s. Continuously improved, HDDs have maintained this position into the modern era of servers and personal computers. More than 200 companies have produced HDDs historically, though after extensive industry consolidation most units are manufactured by Seagate, Toshiba, and Western Digital. HDDs dominate the volume of storage produced (exabytes per year) for servers. Though production is growing slowly, sales revenues and unit shipments are declining because solid-state drives (SSDs) have higher data-transfer rates, higher areal storage density, better reliability,[7] and much lower latency and access times.<br> <br> <a>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_disk_drive </a> </p> </div>

			<div class="col-sm-4" id="row5"><p class="text">History of the Hard Drive <br> <br> The first production IBM hard disk drive, the 350 disk storage, shipped in 1957 as a component of the IBM 305 RAMAC system. It was approximately the size of two medium-sized refrigerators and stored five million six-bit characters (3.75 megabytes) on a stack of 50 disks. <br> <br> In 1962, the IBM 350 was superseded by the IBM 1301 disk storage unit,[29] which consisted of 50 platters, each about 1/8-inch thick and 24 inches in diameter.[30] While the IBM 350 used only two read/write heads,[28] the 1301 used an array of heads, one per platter, moving as a single unit. Cylinder-mode read/write operations were supported, and the heads flew about 250 micro-inches (about 6 Âµm) above the platter surface. Motion of the head array depended upon a binary adder system of hydraulic actuators which assured repeatable positioning. The 1301 cabinet was about the size of three home refrigerators placed side by side, storing the equivalent of about 21 million eight-bit bytes. Access time was about a quarter of a second. <p> </div>
