			<div class="col-sm-4" id="row3"><p class="text">What is a Cooling Fan? <br> <br> A computer fan is any fan inside, or attached to, a computer case used for active cooling, and may refer to fans that draw cooler air into the case from the outside, expel warm air from inside, or move air across a heat sink to cool a particular component. Generally these are found in axial and sometimes centrifugal forms. The former is sometimes called a "electric" fan, after the Rotron Vertical line,[1] while the latter may be called a "biscuit blower" in some product literature.<br> <br> <a>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_fan</a></p></div>

			<div class="col-sm-4" id="row5"><p class="text">Usage of a Cooling Fan <br> <br> As processors, graphics cards, RAM and other components in computers have increased in speed and power consumption, the amount of heat produced by these components as a side-effect of normal operation has also increased. These components need to be kept within a specified temperature range to prevent overheating, instability, malfunction and damage leading to a shortened component lifespan.<br> <br> While in earlier personal computers it was possible to cool most components using natural convection (passive cooling), many modern components require more effective active cooling. To cool these components, fans are used to move heated air away from the components and draw cooler air over them. Fans attached to components are usually used in combination with a heatsink to increase the area of heated surface in contact with the air, thereby improving the efficiency of cooling. Fan control is not always an automatic process. A computer's BIOS (basic input/output system) can control the speed of the built in fan system for the computer. A user can even supplement this function with additional cooling components or connect a manual fan controller with knobs that set fans to different speeds.</p></div>
