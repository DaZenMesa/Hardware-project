			<div class="col-sm-4" id="row3"><p claas="text"> The first commercial floppy disks, developed in the late 1960s, are 8 inches (200 mm) in diameter; they became commercially available in 1971 as a component of IBM products and then were sold separately beginning in 1972 by Memorex and others. These disks and associated drives were produced and improved upon by IBM and other companies such as Memorex, Shugart Associates, and Burroughs Corporation. The term "floppy disk" appeared in print as early as 1970, and although IBM announced its first media as the "Type 1 Diskette" in 1973, the industry continued to use the terms "floppy disk" or "floppy". In 1984 IBM introduced with its PC-AT model the 1.2 MB dual-sided floppy disk.</p></div>
