			<div class="col-sm-4" id="row3"><p class="text"> The first commercial floppy disks, developed in the late 1960s, are 8 inches (200 mm) in diameter; they became commercially available in 1971 as a component of IBM products and then were sold separately beginning in 1972 by Memorex and others. These disks and associated drives were produced and improved upon by IBM and other companies such as Memorex, Shugart Associates, and Burroughs Corporation. The term "floppy disk" appeared in print as early as 1970, and although IBM announced its first media as the "Type 1 Diskette" in 1973, the industry continued to use the terms "floppy disk" or "floppy". In 1984 IBM introduced with its PC-AT model the 1.2 MB dual-sided floppy disk.</p></div>

			<div class="col-sm-4" id="row5"><p class="text"> In 1976, Shugart Associates introduced the ​5 1⁄4-inch FDD. By 1978 there were more than 10 manufacturers producing such FDDs.[6] There were competing floppy disk formats, with hard- and soft-sector versions and encoding schemes such as FM, MFM, M²FM and GCR. The ​5 1⁄4-inch format displaced the 8-inch one for most applications, and the hard-sectored disk format disappeared. The most common capacity of the ​5 1⁄4-inch format in DOS-based PCs was 360 KB. In 1984 IBM introduced with its PC-AT model the 1.2 MB dual-sided floppy disk, but it never became very popular. IBM started using the 720 KB double-density ​3 1⁄2-inch microfloppy disk on its Convertible laptop computer in 1986 and the 1.44 MB high-density version with the PS/2 line in 1987. These disk drives could be added to older PC models. In 1988 IBM introduced a drive for 2.88 MB "DSED" diskettes in its top-of-the-line PS/2 models, but this was a commercial failure.<p></div>
